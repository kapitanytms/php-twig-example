# php-twig-example

I use this project with ampps with 7.1 of php. (You can configure it on the ampps window -> Change PHP Version)
(Or with xampp)

## Prerequisites
Twig needs at least PHP 7.0.0 to run.

## Installation
composer require "twig/twig:^2.0"

You have to donwload php (i use windows -> http://windows.php.net/download#php-7.2 , VC15 x64 Non Thread Safe ) and then composer (https://getcomposer.org/download/)

If everything succeeded, this must work -> http://localhost/php-twig-example

Good Luck! :)
